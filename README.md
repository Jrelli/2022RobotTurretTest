2022RobotTurretTest
Made by Joey Borrelli aka "Jrelli" starting on 4/4/22

GOAL: 
The goal for this program is to create a hypothetical turret, hopefully a real one next depending on the game next year. One in which the turing is controled by a motor with a wheel connected between an inner and outer ring (the outer ring being the moving turret part, and the inner ring being stationary relative to the robot.) I hope to make this turret auto lock using limelight and also adjust for current movement of the robot. Im planning on also using this code and further developing it this summer so that Ty and I might be able to impliment it on a real turret.

BACKGROUND: 
This will be my first time writing code for a robot by my self, I know Java relativly well enough between what ive learned in robotics and AP CS A at school, even though Covid screwed up my freshman and Sophmore years. My Freshman year was getting aquainted to robotics, then covid happened and I started working at my job a lot more because We didn't have any competitions the year of 2021 so i basically didn't do robotics that year. So this year is really my first year in a way. Thankfully theres nothing I can't look up and I can always ask Jovi.

FUTURE: 
If any future robotics programers ever find this and need help add me on discord Jrelli#9599, or look for me on instagram under Jrelli Please use this turret code and swerve code as reference on future robots so it doesn't go to waste. We need to do a better job as a team documenting knowedge past gained. Bellow is a link for swerve documentation done by Ty Johnston. Just for a little background so this doesn't get lost in time, the swerve code and math was written and done by Trey Barret in 2021, so we had to kindof reverse engineer this thing and I don't 100% understand the math.
